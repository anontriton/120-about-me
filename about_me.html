  <div class="my-trip">
    <p>
      Right before the start of this semester, I took a trip with some friends
      from my undergraduate university. We went to Italy and visited Milan,
      Florence, and Rome. The highlight of my trip was seeing the Italian Grand 
      Prix, which is a Formula 1 race. As a fan of the Ferrari team, it was a ton
      of fun getting to see them win the race on their home track. Also, out of
      the three cities that I visited, I have to say that Florence was my favorite
      since it was beautiful and had so much history to it without being as
      chaotic as Rome.

  <div class="favorite-restaurant">
    <a href="okanusa.com">Okan USA</a>
    <p>
      This is my favorite restaurant because it offers affordable and authentic
      Japanese food. I love to get their dinner sets, which come with a bowl of
      rice, miso soup, a salad, and a protein of your choice. They also have some
      classic Japanese street food options such as takoyaki or okonomiyaki. Lots
      of variety without breaking the bank!

  <div class="favorite-food">
    <img src="braised-beef-noodle-soup.png" alt="Braised Beef Noodle Soup">
    <p>
      This is Taiwanese braised beef noodle soup and is my absolute all time 
      favorite dish. I like to eat it after a long session of work or on a cold
      or rainy day. A traditional way of serving this dish (which I also enjoy) 
      is having some pickled mustard greens on the side. The acidity helps cut
      into the richness of the beef broth. It is the ultimate comfort meal!
